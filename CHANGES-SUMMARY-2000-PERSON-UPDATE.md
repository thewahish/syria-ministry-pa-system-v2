## Next Steps

### 1. Client Approval Required:
- [ ] Review updated pricing (12% average increase)
- [ ] Confirm venue can provide 30A circuits
- [ ] Approve selected package
- [ ] Confirm 2000-person / 3000 sq m venue specs are correct

### 2. Venue Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Verify power: 2 × 30A dedicated circuits @ 220V (upgraded from 20A)
- [ ] Verify truss capacity: 300kg per pick point (3 arrays instead of 2)
- [ ] Confirm ceiling height: 5-8m for rigging
- [ ] Confirm truss type: 290-300mm box truss

### 3. Critical Pre-Order Steps:
- [ ] **PRIORITY 1:** Verify wireless frequencies with SY-TPRA (unchanged)
- [ ] Get frequency authorization documentation
- [ ] Specify correct frequency band when ordering
- [ ] Allow 2-4 weeks for regulatory approval

### 4. Installation Planning:
- [ ] Timeline remains 12 days (same)
- [ ] Rigging time increases slightly (more elements)
- [ ] Additional rigging crew may be needed for 3 arrays
- [ ] Power testing critical (verify 30A circuits)

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Why the Increase is Justified:

**Doubling capacity (1000 → 2000 people) requires:**
- +50% more line array elements (8 → 12)
- +100% more subwoofers (2 → 4)
- +60% more power consumption

**But only results in:**
- +41% cost increase for recommended package ($29,300 → $41,420)
- +35-47% average increase across all packages

**This is cost-effective because:**
1. Wireless systems don't need to scale with audience
2. Economies of scale on additional speakers
3. Installation costs remain same
4. Venue now handles events 2x the size

### Alternative: Keep 1000-Person System?
**Not Recommended** because:
- Insufficient SPL for 2000 people
- Coverage gaps in 3000 sq m venue
- Under-powered for venue size
- Poor audio quality at back of venue
- Professional image compromised

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Wireless frequency compliance (process unchanged)
- Installation timeline (12 days still adequate)
- Operator training (same equipment, just more speakers)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Power availability:** Venue must provide 30A circuits (was 20A)
  - **Mitigation:** Verify with venue electrician before purchase
- **Rigging capacity:** 3 arrays instead of 2
  - **Mitigation:** Verify truss load ratings before installation

### Mitigated ✅
- **Budget increase:** +$12,000 average
  - **Mitigation:** VALUE packages still provide significant savings
  - Cost per person served actually decreased ($/person)

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Can we just add more speakers to the old 1000-person system later?
**A:** Not recommended. Better to design correctly from start:
- Matching speaker sets ensure tonal consistency
- Proper system design for 2000 people from beginning
- Avoid partial system upgrades (costly, inconsistent results)
- Get correct flying frames and rigging now

### Q: Do we really need 30A circuits?
**A:** Yes. Technical explanation:
- 16,000W ÷ 220V = 72.7A theoretical
- With power factor and headroom: ~30A per circuit × 2 circuits
- 20A circuits would trip breakers during loud passages
- Professional systems require adequate power overhead

### Q: Can we use 2 arrays of 6 elements instead of 3 arrays of 4?
**A:** Yes, both work:
- **2 arrays of 6 (L/R):** Simpler rigging, wider stereo image
- **3 arrays of 4 (L/C/R):** Better center coverage, easier to aim
- Recommend: Consult with installer based on venue shape

### Q: Why doesn't the wireless system need to be bigger?
**A:** Wireless capacity is about number of speakers, not audience size:
- 6 microphone channels serves 6 speakers (adequate for most events)
- Wireless range (100-150m) already covers 3000 sq m venue
- No additional wireless equipment needed
