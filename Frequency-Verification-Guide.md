## EQUIPMENT ORDERING CONSIDERATIONS

### Before You Order:

**1. Specify Frequency Band to Manufacturer**

When ordering, you MUST tell the manufacturer:
```
Example: "Please configure all wireless equipment for Band A1 (516-558 MHz)
for use in Syria."
```

**Why:** Equipment is often factory-configured for specific regions:
- US models: 470-698 MHz range
- EU models: Different bands (G50, A1, etc.)
- Wrong region = equipment is ILLEGAL in Syria

**2. Request Documentation**

Ask manufacturer to include:
- [ ] Frequency specifications certificate
- [ ] Type approval documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] CE certification (Syria accepts European standards)
- [ ] User manual showing frequency range
- [ ] Declaration of conformity
- [ ] Power output specifications

**3. Pre-Approval Strategy**

BEFORE ordering $32,530 of equipment:
1. Get frequency bands from SY-TPRA
2. Confirm with manufacturer they can supply that band
3. Get written confirmation from manufacturer
4. Then place order

## RED FLAGS / THINGS TO AVOID

### DON'T:
- ❌ Order equipment without verifying Syrian frequencies first
- ❌ Assume "European" equipment will work in Syria
- ❌ Use frequencies from other countries (even neighbors)
- ❌ Order "universal" or "world" band equipment without confirmation
- ❌ Rely on dealer promises without checking official sources

### DO:
- ✅ Get official written confirmation from SY-TPRA
- ✅ Order equipment specifically configured for Syria
- ✅ Keep all frequency documentation for customs
- ✅ Budget extra time for bureaucracy (add 4 weeks buffer)
- ✅ Consider hiring consultant if urgent ($500-2000 but saves months)

## IF YOU CAN'T GET SYRIAN FREQUENCY INFO

### Fallback Strategy:

**Option 1: Order Most Common European Band (A1)**
- Band A1 (516-558 MHz) is used in most CEPT countries
- Syria likely follows European standards (ERC 70-03)
- Most likely to be legal
- **Risk:** Medium - not guaranteed without confirmation

**Option 2: Order "Wide Band" Model**
- Some Sennheiser models allow frequency tuning across multiple bands
- EW-D series: Some models cover 506-558 MHz (multiple bands)
- Can be adjusted after arrival if needed
- **Risk:** Low - more flexible, slightly higher cost

**Option 3: Wait for Confirmation**
- Don't risk $32,530 on wrong frequencies
- Delay project 1-2 months to verify
- Order correct equipment the first time
- **Risk:** None - but project delayed

**Our Recommendation:** Use Method 4 (hire IB-Lenhardt consultant)
- Cost: ~$1,500-2,500
- Timeline: 2 weeks for definitive answer
- Worth it for $32,530 equipment investment
