# NOTES & RECOMMENDATIONS

## Why Mid-Range VALUE Package is Recommended: ⭐ BEST CHOICE

1. **Smart Savings: $3,230 less than full Mid-Range**
   - 4 wireless + 2 wired gives same 6 mic coverage
   - Wired mics perfect for fixed podiums/positions
   - No compromise on sound quality or functionality

2. **Digital Wireless Quality**
   - Same excellent Sennheiser EW-D digital wireless
   - 100m operating range
   - Rechargeable batteries (lower operating costs)
   - Auto frequency coordination

3. **Full Professional Sound**
   - Same QSC KLA12 line array + subwoofers
   - Full bass extension (41 Hz - 20 kHz)
   - 130 dB SPL output
   - 1000 person venue capacity

4. **Easy Frequency Coordination**
   - Only 4 wireless channels to coordinate (vs 6)
   - All Sennheiser = seamless integration
   - Less wireless = less interference risk
   - Wired mics need no frequency management

5. **Professional Appearance**
   - Mix of wireless + wired is industry standard
   - Wired mics at podiums look professional
   - Wireless for movement/flexibility
   - Suitable for government/ministry use

6. **Lower Risk**
   - Only ~$10,500 of wireless equipment (vs $14,000)
   - If frequency issues arise, smaller loss exposure
   - Wired mics always work (no regulatory issues)

7. **Practical for Most Events**
   - Most ministry events have 2-3 fixed speaking positions
   - 4 wireless channels sufficient for roaming presenters
   - Total 6 microphone positions covered

## Why NOT Full Mid-Range (6 Wireless)?

Ask yourself: "Do we really need 6 people with wireless mics simultaneously?"
- Most events: 2-3 speakers at podiums (wired works great)
- Plus 4 wireless for flexibility
- **Saves $3,230 with no practical limitation**

## Frequency Coordination Notes:
- All wireless systems must be on compatible frequencies
- **Mid-Range Value Package**: 4 wireless mics + 2 IEMs = 6 total wireless channels (easier!)
- **Mid-Range Package**: 6 wireless mics + 2 IEMs = 8 total wireless channels
- **All Sennheiser packages**: Easiest coordination (same brand)
- **Premium Package**: All Shure = seamless integration
- **Budget Package**: Shure BLX + PSM 300 = same manufacturer, good coordination

## Syria-Specific Considerations:
1. **Wireless Frequencies**: Verify legal UHF bands in Syria
   - Typical: 518-566 MHz, 606-614 MHz
   - May require telecommunications license
2. **Power**: All equipment is 220V/50Hz compatible
3. **Spare Parts**: Recommend 20% spare battery inventory
4. **Training**: Include operator training for digital systems

## Warranty & Support:
- Shure: 2-year warranty (ULXD), 1-year (BLX, PSM)
- Sennheiser: 2-year warranty (all EW series)
- QSC: 6-year warranty (speakers)
- JBL: 3-year warranty
- d&b: 2-year warranty
